She realised that everyone in the world was going through something extraordinary at the same time. India is all about its sounds. The familiar sounds of vegetable sellers, children playing in the streets, people speaking in different languages and so much more suddenly went all quiet. Her writings on the pandemic include what she saw in her city Hyderabad. The main focus of her writings has been India but she has mentioned what the other countries worldwide were going through at the same time as well. On top of her experiences, she also maintained a daily toll of total Covid-19 cases and deaths in India. She has been writing every day since Day 1 of the nation lockdown and now her writings titled ‘500 days of the Pandemic’ are under consideration for publication as a book. 500 Days of the Pandemic follows Amrita’s experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic from 25th March 2020 to 6th August 2021. Some excerpts can be found below (to follow soon). "

    "body": "  Amrita Kundu is an independent documentary filmmaker based in Hyderabad, India. Her interest in making documentaries cultivated while she was a Broadcast Journalism student in Asian College of Journalism where she along with other team members made two documentaries. One was on the plight of the silk saree weavers of Kanchipuram and the other was on the effects of living near a nuclear power plant on the people of Ratnagiri. To further understand the nuances of the craft, she learnt documentary filmmaking and screenplay writing for a semester in Cornell University where she made a documentary on the effects of climate change as was seen on the Ithaca campus of the university. Upon her return to India, she has travelled to various states like West Bengal, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh to tell the stories of indigenous art forms and how they have changed with time. Most of her documentaries focus on the lives of the weaver community as she wishes to document the stories of various handlooms present in India. During the Covid-19 pandemic, she started writing down her experiences of living in India at that time and also of what was happening at other places in the world because of the pandemic. The journalistic work of what she saw and experienced is now under consideration for publication as ‘500 Days of the Pandemic. ’ Amrita had taken a career break to tend to personal responsibilities but even during that time she kept her work skills updated by producing six documentaries and screenplays. She has also ventured into online education and has earned certificates in Machine Learning from Stanford University and Korean language from Yonsei University. While she has learnt to read and write Hangul, she is very enthusiastic about learning to speak Korean language fluently. She is now looking for opportunities to return to work for the longer term where her expertise can be utilised. "

The first half of the documentary focuses on the silk making process whereas the later half sheds light on the lives of the artisans and ponders over the question whether silk making will end up becoming a dying art.

But before all this, the sculptors collect the maati, that is the clay from riverbanks and apply it on the hay models of the protimas that they have already prepared. Unlike other traditional art works, many youngsters are occupied in this line of work and find the work of hands fulfilling.  Click here to watch the documentary "
