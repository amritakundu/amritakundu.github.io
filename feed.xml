Silk Threads tells the story of how silk is being made from scratch. The focus here is on the artisans who separate the silk threads from the cocoons and turn them into beautiful silk yarns.
The first half of the documentary focuses on the silk making process whereas the later half sheds light on the lives of the artisans and ponders over the question whether silk making will end up becoming a dying art.&lt;/p&gt;
